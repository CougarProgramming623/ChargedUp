	Arm.cpp 56-64
	double currentAngle = PivotTicksToDeg(m_Pivot.GetSelectedSensorPosition()); //current angle of the arm
	double degToMove = angle - currentAngle; //how many degrees the arm needs to move in the correct direction
	ticksToMove = PivotDegToTicks(degToMove); //how many ticks the pivot motor needs to move in the correct direction
	setpoint = startingTicks + ticksToMove;

	DebugOutF("setpoint");
	DebugOutF(std::to_string(setpoint));
	DebugOutF(std::to_string(startingTicks));
	DebugOutF(std::to_string(ticksToMove));
	

	ticksToMove is a HUGE value- will need to check the function to convert values between degrees and ticks. it looks like whatever happens in
	line 58 goes wrong and produces a HUGE value (also flip flops between negative and positive22)
